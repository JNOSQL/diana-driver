/**
 * Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of
 * data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers
 * robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low
 * latency operations for all clients.
 * Cassandra also places a high value on performance. In 2012,
 * University of Toronto researchers studying NoSQL systems concluded that "In terms of scalability, there is a clear
 * winner throughout our experiments. Cassandra achieves the highest throughput for the maximum number
 * of nodes in all experiments" although "this comes at the price of high write and read latencies.
