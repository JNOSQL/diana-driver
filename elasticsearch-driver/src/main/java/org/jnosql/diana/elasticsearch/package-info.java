/**
 *  <p>Elasticsearch is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search
 *  engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is released
 *  as open source under the terms of the Apache License. Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine
 *  followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene.</p>
 *  <p>It is developed alongside a data collection and log parsing engine called Logstash,
 *  and an analytics and visualization platform called Kibana. The three products are designed to be used as an integrated
 *  solution, referred to as the "ELK stack".</p>
